          Hello there! I'm Rafael and as a professional I'm a telecommunications engineer focuses in networking field, I've been working as a data center support engineer the last 4 years. 
        </p> 
        <p>
          During pandemic, I started learning web programing through freecodecamp where I learned the basics of html/css, then I moved to some javascript courses, and lastly learning Vue js as a web application framework.
        </p>
        
         <p>
          I have made some projects that you can check on my github profile, my final goal is to create web applications that involve latest technologies such as firebase, apis and finally learn how to develop machine learning applications that can help the world. 
         </p>
         <p>
           This portfolio was made with vue js and quasar. And yes, that picture it's me in a place an hour from where I live.
