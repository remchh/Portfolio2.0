          During pandemic, I started learning web programing through freecodecamp where I learned the basics of html/css, then I moved to some javascript courses, and lastly learning Vue js as a web application framework.
        </p>
        
         <p>
          I have made some projects that you can check on my github profile, my main goal is to create web applications that involve latest technologies such as firebase, apis and finally learn how to develop machine learning applications that can help the world. 
         </p>
